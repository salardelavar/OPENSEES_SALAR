"""
When OK equals -1, it generally indicates that the command or operation was not executed
because it was already in progress or had already been completed. This can happen if you
try to run a command that is already running or has been completed in a previous step.

When OK equals -2, it typically indicates that the command or operation was not executed
because it was not recognized or not implemented. This could mean that the command
is either misspelled, not available in the current version of OpenSees, or not applicable to the current context.

When OK equals -3, it typically means that the command or operation failed.
This could be due to various reasons, such as incorrect input parameters,
syntax errors, or issues with the model setup.
